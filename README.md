ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Josh Kladis, aka GreyFenix.Codes.

I am an aspiring programmer looking to get into front-end development.

I graduated from Colorado Technical University with a BS in Information Technology and have been learning and practicing programming ever since.

I have a background with C++ from college, and after college I learned Python. I found that I really enjoyed working on the front end, getting things in place and being able to see the effects of your code in real time,  so I began learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I continued to learn frameworks/Libraries like Bootstrap, Sass, and now starting on React JS.

My github contains random projects I have worked on, as well as repos I have cloned in order to learn and tweak to my needs.
